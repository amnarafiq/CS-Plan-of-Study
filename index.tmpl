  		<h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>This web app allows you to prepare your Plan of Study (PoS). Please
        read this carefully as this is a quick-and-dirty application that
        works in particular ways and does only a few things. Hopefully it
        does those few things well enough for you to find use and value.</p>

      <p>First, this web app only lets you fill out a plan of study. It
        does not save the plan of study, nor does it submit it for you.
        So in a way, it is more of a smart form than an full fledge 
        web app. There are many reasons why it does only that service,
        but none of them are relevant here and now. This means that you
        have to prepare your plan of study in one sitting. We strongly 
        suggest you meet with your advisor and plan what courses you 
        will take. Once you settle on a group of courses that make
        sense, come here and fill out the plan of study.</p>

      <p>Second, the normal way of processing a plan of study requires
        the student printing a form and collecting signatures from 
        his/her graduate committee
        and submitting this form to the CS department. The details of 
        the plan of study are then entered into a university provided 
        system where it is then approved by the graduate program director 
        before it is submitted (electronically) to the graduate school.  
        This web app does not replace that process, just makes the
        preparation of the form a bit easier.  The student still has to
        collect signatures, and we (the department) have to enter 
        all the information online by hand, approve it, and send it
        to the graduate school.</p>

      <p>Finally, as you fill out the form, the app does a validation
        where a number of things are checked against the rules
        for plans of study stated in the CS Graduate Handbook. Once
        all of the rules are met, then you can print the plan of study,
        collect signatures and turn in the form in the CS office. The
        printed copy will include the output of these checks (problems 
        and notices).
        It is possible that your plan of study will have
        special circumstances (e.g., transfers, approved cognates out
        of the list of preapproved courses, new special topics) that
        cannot be handled by the app.  In those cases, you can still
        print out the form and submit it, it will just include some
        checks and notices that will make it easier for the department
        to process. Any other out of the norm situation, you can include
        a comment in the form in the space provided.</p>
