# CS-Plan-of-Study

Plan of study online form for the CS Graduate Program.

This program is typically installed under the GPC directory and thus shares the php files stored in the directory above. Two particular files are of importance:

    require_once("../vendor/autoload.php");
    require_once("../dept_data.php");

The dept_data.php contains constants and array definitions.
The vendor holds all the external tools installed with composer. This tool (POS) requires the template package (by yours truly) and a Markdown package.

More documentation will be provided later.
